Stuffer - simplified, container-friendly provisioning
=====================================================

Stuffer is a provisioning tool designed to be simple, and to be used in
simple scenarios.


Project status
--------------

Just started. The documents describe intentions, some of which are not implemented.


Use cases
---------

Stuffer is primarily intended to be used for provisioing container images, Docker in particular. As
a secondary use case, it can be used to provision non-production machines, e.g. developer machines.

More complex provisioning tools, such as Puppet, Chef, and Ansible, are intended for bringing a
machine in any state to a desired state. This turns out not to be possible in practice, and
production machines manages with such tools tend to suffer from outdated dependency packages, etc.

Stuffer is primarily intended for building a machine from scratch to the desired state. Since the
initial state is known, much of the complexity of existing provisioning tools is unnecessary.


Overview
--------

Stuffer uses a Python embedded DSL for specifying provisioning directives. It is typically invoked
with one or more command arguments on the command line, e.g.:
::

    stuffer 'apt.Install("mercurial")'


Multiple arguments are concatenated into a multiple line Python recipe:
::

    stuffer \
      'for pkg in "mercurial", "gradle", "python-nose":' \
      '  print("Installing", pkg)' \
      '  apt.Install(pkg)'


Reused recipes can be factored out into Python modules for easier reuse:
::

    stuffer 'development.Tools()'

    development.py:
      from stuffer.core import Group

      class Tools(Group):
        def children(self):
          return [apt.Install(p) for p in "mercurial", "gradle", "python-nose"]

Stuffer comes with builtin knowledge of Docker best practices, which it
can enforce for you:

::

    Dockerfile:
      FROM phusion/baseimage:0.9.18

      RUN stuffer 'docker.Prologue()'  # Verifies e.g. that base image is sound.

      RUN stuffer ... # Install stuff

      RUN stuffer 'docker.Epilogue()'  # Cleans temporary files, warns about known anti-patterns in the statements above.


Design goals
------------

Stuffer design gives priority to:

-  Simplicity of use. No knowledge about the tool should be required in order to use it for simple scenarios by copying
   examples. Some simplicity in the implementation is sacrificed in order to make the usage interface simple. Actions
   are named similarly to the corresponding shell commands.

-  Transparency. Whenever possible, actions are translated to shell commands. All actions are logged.

-  Ease of reuse. It should be simple to extract commands from snippets and convert them to reusable modules without a
   rewrite.

-  Docker cache friendliness. Images built with similar commands should be able to share a prefix of commands in order
   to benefit from Docker image caching.

-  No dislike factors. Provisioning tools tend to be loved and/or hated by users, for various reasons. There might be no
   reason to be enamoured with stuffer, but there should be no reason to have a strong dislike for it, given that you
   approve of Python and Docker.

-  Ease of debugging. Debugging stuffer recipes should be as easy as debugging standard Python programs.

-  Avoid reinventing wheels. Use existing Python modules or external tools for tasks that have already been solved. Give
   priority to reusing existing code over minimising dependencies. In particular, use Python 3 and click to save
   boilerplate.


Moreover, the project model is design to facilitate sharing and reuse of code between users, see below.


DSL
---

The DSL is designed to be comprehensible by readers that are not familiar with stuffer. For example,
the command apt.Install("mypack") runs "apt-get install mypack". There is a balance between
convenience and comprehensibility, and stuffer in most cases shuns magic that would create
convenience in preference for more understandable code.

The DSL is also designed to make it easy to do things that are correct and work well with
containers, and difficult to do things that do not harmonise with containers.

The DSL is designed to be tool friendly (IntelliJ/PyCharm and pylint in particular), both for
writing stuff files and for working on stuffer itself. For example, all imports are explicitly
declared in order to make structure visible to tools.

Python conventions are used for naming, i.e. CamelCase classes and snake_case functions.


Collaboration model
-------------------

Users are encouraged to put recipes under sites/ for others to get inspired. One package will be
built for each site. This model may not scale, but as long as the number of users is small, there is
value in sharing and showing each other code snippets, in order to extract pieces of common value.

Snippets worth reuse can be put under stuffer/contrib/. Files under stuffer/contrib are expected to
be maintained by the contributor.

Routines for installing third-party software should also go under stuffer/contrib.


Contributing
------------

New code should be covered with integration tests. Avoid unit tests - since the purpose of stuffer is integration,
there is little value testing scenarios that are not authentic. Strive to figure out a way to test functionality with
Docker containers.

In order to run the test suite, run "tox" in the project root directory.

When tests pass, fork https://bitbucket.org/mapflat/stuffer, push your code to the fork and create a pull request.


Deployment
----------

In order to create an installable distribution package, run "./setup.py sdist" from the project root directory.
Install with "pip3 install dist/stuffer-*.tar.gz".
